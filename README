gme2mp3 - game music to MP3

Scans the current directory (recursively) for SNES (.spc) and NES
music (.nsfe) and converts to MP3s using lame. Requires lame and gme,
plus the new C++17 filesystem library.

SNES files are assumed to be in the format:

Game/Track. Title.spc

NES files are assumed to have all of their metadata correctly
specified in the .nsfe archive.

The result MP3 is stereo 44.1KHz with level 9 VBR. (This is the lowest
level of encoding the lame offers. In my experience, it sounds perfect
because these computers had such bad sound to begin with.)

It does not create any intermediate files (i.e. no WAV) which is one
of the reasons I wrote it.
